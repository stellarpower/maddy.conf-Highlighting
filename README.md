# Syntax highlighting for Maddy' Configuration Files

This adds basic VS Code/TextMate highlighting for the Maddy mailserver's configuration files.

It was converted using AI from the [vim syntax in the officiel repo](https://github.com/foxcpp/maddy/blob/master/dist/vim/syntax/maddy-conf.vim) and is no doubt far from complete or accurate. However, loading the example configuration, most seems to be highlighted, and it is - for me at least - better than nothing. So I am unlikely to spend any further time on it, but am sharing it if of use to anyone else.

Also provided is highlighting for Maddy's logging files. The semantic token type may not be optimal; not lal types are supported and thus I have selected colours that look good in my current colour theme. These may be adjusted easily to your own preferences (see the TextMate grammar reference).
